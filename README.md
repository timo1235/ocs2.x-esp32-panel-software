# OPEN-CNC-Shield 2.x ESP32 Panel Software

This project contains the software for an ESP32 handwheel as an remote control for the OPEN-CNC-Shield 2.x and is still under development.
The corresponding ESP32 software of the OPEN-CNC-Shield ESP32 can be found here: [OPEN-CNC-Shield 2.x ESP32 Software](https://github.com/timo1235/ocs2.x-esp32-software).

## Howto install
Open this project folder in VS Code with PlatformIO IDE and upload it to the ESP32. A good documentation how to get the IDE up and running can be found here:
[Getting Started with VS Code and PlatformIO IDE](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/vs-code-platformio-ide-esp32-esp8266-arduino/)

### Configuration
Take a look at the `src/pinmap.h` for the pin mapping of functions and at `src/configuration` for the configuration.

## Features implemented so far
- Read inputs and send them via Wifi to the Shield ESP32
- Show the current status on a i2c display
- Calibrate all the joystick axes and feedrate and rotation speed poti
  - very useful if the axes are swaped or the middle position is not right

## To be done
- implement connection over RJ45 - Serial communication

## Hint for PCB version 1.04
The menu button on the pcb is not working due to the onboard led. So button4 as used as menu button by default. Just use some push button between button4 and GND for 3 seconds to start the calibration process. This will be fixed with the next pcb version.

## Menu button
- Short press: Go through the different settings - changes can not be made here. Only when uploading the firmware.
- long press > 3 seconds: Start the calibration process
- long press > 6 seconds: Reset the calibration config - like resetting to factory defaults
